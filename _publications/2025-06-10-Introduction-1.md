**Reflection**

**Learning Outcome**
Through this experience, I gained a better understanding of how the learning platform is organized and became aware of the available support services, such as academic and administrative assistance. I also learned key principles for academic writing in English, particularly how to correctly use the Harvard referencing style. Furthermore, I was introduced to essay structures through articles that guided me on how to effectively construct essays and manage citations.

**Practical Application**
I am now more confident in navigating the platform and accessing support when required. The knowledge gained about writing in academic English and applying Harvard references will be invaluable for future essays and assignments. The articles on essay formatting remain a useful resource that I can return to whenever I need help.

**Critical Reflection**
The essay assignment presented a challenge, mainly due to the need to adapt to academic English and be meticulous with citations. The requirement to reference everything was a new concept for me, especially since it differs from practices in Denmark and the US. However, as I gained more experience, I found the process easier and more intuitive than initially anticipated.

**Learning Process**
Reading the recommended articles on essay writing and academic style proved beneficial. These resources made it easier to get started and quickly became an essential part of my writing process.

**Broader Context**
This introduction reinforced that academic writing and accurate referencing are essential skills throughout the entire master's program, no matter the specific subject. It also emphasized the importance of adapting to different academic cultures, with these principles ultimately promoting clarity and quality in research.

**Future Direction**
I plan to continue refining my academic writing style to make it more natural and efficient in future modules. Iâ€™ll also keep the articles on essay structure and referencing as a go-to reference for any needed guidance.
